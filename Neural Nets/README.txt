A Neural Net assignment through Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning course. 

Using PyTorch, I trained a neural net model to classify flowers. I wrote python scripts, train.py and predict.py, to
create and apply the model. The scripts are able to take multiple arguments, such as number of epochs or whether to
run on the cpu or gpu.
